        <p><b>Values and Guideline</b><br>
    The main project values are responsibility, democracy, equality. </p>
<p><b>Responsibility</b>  - Each team member must show responsibility towards their work and other team members.</p>
<p><b>Democracy</b>  - The decisions of project development will be made through the principles of democracy by that meaning consideration of others opinion, 
    active discussions and joint agreement. </p>
<p><b>Equality</b>  - Each team member must respect and perceive others as equal members of the team.</p>
<p><b>Resolving conflicts</b> <br>
    In our team, during the whole time that will be spent working on the project, rather strict rules will be implied, 
    to keep some basic structure and make sure everybody knows their duties and responsibilities as well as to help minimise the amount of potential conflict situations. 
    One of the simplest, but at the same time biggest problems working on a project like this could be the lack of communication and dedication between the members. 
    To avoid this, especially, if there are prior known difficulties, team members are obligated to inform  others at least 3 days before a meeting or a deadline. 
    In the case of members breaking any rules or failing to inform others about their difficulties, measures will be taken and they will be punished accordingly.
    We are planning to maintain a 3 strike system. The very first strike will be a vocally announced  warning. 
    If a member breaks the rules a second time, he/she will be obligated to cover the expenses of the rest team members lunch costs for the next meeting. 
    If a member fails the team 3 times, he will be terminated from the team and from further work on the project.</p>
<p><b>Communication</b> <br>
    Primary sources of our communication will be a WhatsApp group, a GitHub repository and in person.  We have decided that WhatsApp will be used for exchanging ideas,
    updates and setting weekly goals.  GitHub will be used for realization purposes and for practical and realization progress assessment like coding. </p>
<p><b>Storing documents</b> <br>
    Generally the project-related documents will be kept in a shared Google Drive.
    Our team chose this approach because with the help of Google Drive all members of the team will be able to access the updated versions of containing files and work on them online. </p>
<p><b>Project updates</b> <br>
    The overall agenda and list of tasks will be available via Github.</p>
<p><b>Project artefacts and deliverables</b> <br>
    We have decided that we will keep all of our projects artefacts and deliverables like photos, videos, html code and different types of files in github. 
    In our opinion, github will be the best place for this, because all of us have at least some knowledge of using github, which makes it easier and a more preferable choice for us.</p>
<p><b>Meetings</b> <br>
    We have planned to hold meetings every Friday after the First Year Seminar at RBS. 
    In case due to illness or other obstacles a members of team will not be able to join on site, they must ensure their presence online and still have to continue working
    on their tasks remotely.  </p>
<p><b>Delegation process and task achievement</b> <br>
    We will keep track of the responsibilities of each team member with the help of an online project organization tool in GitHub. 
    The tasks will be mainly divided according to each team memberâ€™s skill set,  availability and workload.  
    Within the delegation process following aspects will be defined : <br>
    1)	Reason for the task <br>
    2)	Selection of responsible person and support members<br>
    3)	Required results of the activity <br>
    4)	Deadline </p>
<p>For each project activity the responsible team member will receive feedback regarding their work. 
    In case the responsible team member notices that the project activity requires a reschedule, the responsible team member must inform others via Whatsapp group <b>at least 3 days prior.</b> <br>
    In order to ensure team efficiency there will be weekly 10 minute meetings, where the team members will report their progress on  individual task achievement, difficulties, 
    needed support and further steps. </p>
